# Abstract:
CD8 T cell differentiation is controlled by the crosstalk of various transcription factors and epigenetic modulators. Uncovering the different players in regulating this process is fundamental to improving immunotherapy and designing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we show that Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC)1 subunit Chromobox (Cbx)4 favors differentiation to effector CD8 T cells. Cbx4 deficiency in CD8 T cells induced transcriptional signature and phenotype of memory cells, increasing the formation of memory population during acute viral infection. It has been previously shown that besides chromodomain-mediated binding to H3K27me3, Cbx4 function as a SUMO E3 ligase in a SUMO interacting motifs (SIM)-dependent way. The overexpression of Cbx4 mutants in distinct domains showed that this protein regulates CTL differentiation primarily in a SIM-dependent way and partially through its chromodomain. Our data revealed a novel role of a Polycomb group protein Cbx4 controlling CD8 T lymphocyte differentiation and indicates the SUMOylation process as a key molecular mechanism connected to chromatin modification in this process.
