# Abstract:
Viral RNA is a common activator of antiviral responses. In this review, we dissect the mechanism of viral RNA recognition by the small interfering RNA pathway in Drosophila melanogaster. This antiviral response in fruit flies can help understand general principles of nucleic acid recognition.
