# Abstract:
 Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization in the upper respiratory tract is linked to pneumococcal disease development, predominantly affecting young children and older adults. As the global population ages and comorbidities increase, there is a heightened concern about this infection. We investigated the immunological responses of older adults to pneumococcal-controlled human infection by analyzing the cellular composition and gene expression in the nasal mucosa. Our comparative analysis with data from a concurrent study in younger adults revealed distinct gene expression patterns in older individuals susceptible to colonization, highlighted by neutrophil activation and elevated levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10. Unlike younger adults challenged with pneumococcus, older adults did not show recruitment of monocytes into the nasal mucosa following nasal colonization. However, older adults who were protected from colonization showed increased degranulation of cluster of differentiation 8+ T cells, both before and after pneumococcal challenge. These findings suggest age-associated cellular changes, in particular enhanced mucosal inflammation, that may predispose older adults to pneumococcal colonization.
